Build a clean, professional real-estate website for a local, trust-based real-estate service in India.

Business model:
This is an offline-first, commission-based real-estate business. Properties are physically verified by the team and presented online mainly using real videos. Trust, transparency, and local expertise are the core values.

Service area:
Harohalli, Kanakapura Road, Ramanagara, and nearby regions.
The website should clearly state that it helps Bangalore buyers find verified properties in these surrounding areas, but it does NOT deal directly in Bangalore city properties.

Important location rule (VERY IMPORTANT):

Do NOT show exact property locations, plot numbers, survey numbers, or exact Google Maps pins.

Instead, display property locations using “Near XYZ landmark”, village/area name, and distance references (for example: “45 minutes from NICE Road”).

If a map is used, it must show only an approximate area or landmark, clearly labeled as “Approximate Location”.

Add a short transparency note stating that exact location and documents are shared only after direct contact to protect owner privacy and ensure verified site visits.

Target audience:
Serious property buyers looking for plots, sites, and farmhouses who value verified information and personal guidance.
